# Super Spectrogram
Apply a STFT in a short-length .wav audio file in order to analyse its Time-Frequency response. Useful for identify musical notes being played.

Using the powerful Matlab visualization tools, it allows the user to get a detailed analysis of the input waveform.

The input should be a short length .wav file, better if sampled at 44.100 kHz.
I usually use Audacity together with this application.
